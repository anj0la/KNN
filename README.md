# K-Nearest Neighbours
This repository contains the source code for the implmentation of the KNN algorithm in Python.
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
